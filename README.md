To-Do List in Python with Tkinter:
1. UI Design:
Use Tkinter, a built-in GUI library in Python, to create a simple window for the to-do list.
Include a text entry widget to add new tasks.
Display a listbox to show the existing tasks.
Add buttons for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
2. Functionality:
When the user enters a new task and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the listbox.
Provide an option to delete selected tasks from the listbox using the "Delete" button.
Allow marking tasks as completed, perhaps by changing their appearance or moving them to a separate section.
Implement a clear or reset button to remove all tasks from the list.
3. Data Storage:
Store the tasks in a data structure (e.g., a Python list).
When the application starts, load the existing tasks into the listbox.
4. Example Code Skeleton:

   import tkinter as tk

def add_task():
    # Add a new task to the listbox
    task = entry.get()
    if task:
        listbox.insert(tk.END, task)
        entry.delete(0, tk.END)

def delete_task():
    # Delete the selected task from the listbox
    selected_task_index = listbox.curselection()
    if selected_task_index:
        listbox.delete(selected_task_index)

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("To-Do List")

# Create widgets
entry = tk.Entry(root, width=30)
add_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add", command=add_task)
delete_button = tk.Button(root, text="Delete", command=delete_task)
listbox = tk.Listbox(root, selectmode=tk.SINGLE)

# Place widgets on the window
entry.pack(pady=10)
add_button.pack()
listbox.pack(pady=10)
delete_button.pack()

# Start the main loop
root.mainloop()
